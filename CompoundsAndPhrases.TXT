it all depends
it beats me
it beats the Dutch
it beggar'd all description
it being provided
it came like a bolt from the blue
it came to pass
it can be supposed
it cannot be helped
it does not matter
it does not signify
it fell off the back of a lorry
it follows that
It girl
It Girl
it girl
it goes to show
it goes without saying
it has me guessing
it is all the same
it is all up
it is all up with
it is certain
it is fated
it is for a fact
it is lightening
it is meat and drink to me
it is mizzling
it is necessary
it is no go
it is of no consequence
it is of no importance
it is proven
it is raining
it is said
it is sleeting
it is snowing
it is spotting
it is sprinkling
it is storming
it is that
it is thawing
it is thundering
it is written
it lightens
it makes no difference
it makes no odds
it matters not
it may be
it might be thought
it mizzles
it must be
it must follow
it must have its way
it must needs be
it needs must be
it never rains but it pours
it pours
it rains
it says
it seems
it sleets
it snows
it spots
it sprinkles
it stands to reason
it storms
it strikes me
it takes a thief to catch a thief
it takes all sorts
it takes all sorts to make a world
it takes one to know one
it takes two
it takes two to tango
it thaws
it thunders
It was a Lover and His Lass
It was the best of times it was the worst of times
it will all come out in the wash
it will be
it will be all right on the night
it will stand
it won't wash
it would appear
it would seem

it's all good

it's an ill wind
it's an ill wind that blows no one any good
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it's better to give than to receive
it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness

it's easy to be wise after the event

it's Greek to me
it's in the bag

it's never too late
it's no go
it's no skin off my nose
it's no use crying over spilt milk
it's no use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
It's not cricket
it's not worth crying over spilt milk
It's that man again
it's the early bird that gets the worm
it's the empty can that makes the most noise
it's the squeaky wheel that gets the grease
it's too bad
it's too deep for me

there and back
there and then
there are no two ways about it
there are none so blind as those that will not see
there but for the grace of god go I
there is
There is a tavern in the town
there is no help for it
there is no helping it
there is no knowing
there is no question
there is no saying
there is no telling
there is not a shadow of doubt
there is nothing more to be said
there is nothing to it
there is reason to believe
there it is
there now
there off
there or thereabouts
There she blows
there there
there you are
there you go
thereby hangs a tale
therefore because of this
therefore on account of this
There'll always be an England
there's
there's a thing
there's a war on
there's a way
there's always more fish in the sea
there's an R in the month
there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip
there's method in my madness
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's no accounting for taste
there's no fool like an old fool
there's no I in team
there's no place like home
there's no smoke without fire
there's no such thing as a free lunch
there's no such thing as bad publicity
there's no telling
there's no time like the present
there's no two ways about it
there's none so deaf as they that will not hear
there's nowt so queer as folk
there's the rub

When a man is tired of London he is tired of life
when all is said and done
when and where
when day is done
when hell freezes over
when in Rome
when in Rome do as the Romans do
when it is handy
when Johnny comes marching home
when one door shuts another opens
when one's ship comes in
when pigs fly
when push comes to shove
when the balloon goes up
when the cat's away
when the cat's away the mice will play
when the chips are down
When the going gets tough the tough get going
when the mood strikes
when the shit hits the fan
when the spirit moves
when you get around to it
when you have a minute to spare
when you have the time
when your ship comes in

where is it
where it's at
where one lives
where the bee sucks there suck I
where the earth meets the sky
where the shoe pinches
where the sun beats
where the sun rises
where there's a will
where there's a will there's a way
where there's life
where there's muck
where there's muck there's brass

you are mistaken
you are right

you can bank on it

you can bet your bottom dollar
you can have too much of a good thing
you can just bet
you can make book on it
you can say that again
you can talk
you can't get a quart into a pint pot
you can't get blood out of a stone
You Can't Go Home Again
you can't go wrong
you can't have your cake and eat it
you can't make a silk purse from a sow's ear
you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
you can't make bricks without straw
you can't please everyone
you can't talk
you can't teach an old dog new tricks
you can't tell a book by its cover
you can't win
you can't win 'em all
You come most carefully upon your hour
you could have knocked me down with a feather
you dirty rat
you don't say
you have another guess coming
you know
you look as if you've been dragged through a hedge backwards
you mark my words
you must be joking
you name it
you never can tell
you never know
you pays your money and you takes your choice
you said a mouthful
you said it
you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
you should live so long
you should worry
you shouldn't have
you speak truly

you want to bet
